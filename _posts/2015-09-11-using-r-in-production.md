I wrote a post over at the [Manufacturing Big Data](http://www.systeminsights.com/blog) blog about the things I learnt while using R in production at System Insights. [Here is the link](http://www.systeminsights.com/blog/2015/9/10/using-r-in-production).

Note (2017-03-10): The link to the post mentioned seems to be down at the moment. [Please visit the page on Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20160905121406/http://www.systeminsights.com:80/blog/2015/9/10/using-r-in-production).
