I gave a talk at the [Machine learning India - Bangalore](https://www.meetup.com/Machine-Learning-India-Bangalore/) meetup today. My aim for the talk was to increase awareness about the [Data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in/) portal, and to give an introduction about how the [ogdindiar](https://github.com/steadyfish/ogdindiar) package helps in simplifying access to the portal. The presentation can be accessed [here](/2017-03-25-ogdindar-presentation). The slides were created using RMarkdown, and the RMarkdown file can be accessed at [gist.github.com/sainathadapa/72a2412f512dde220307b1f907dc62f6](https://gist.github.com/sainathadapa/72a2412f512dde220307b1f907dc62f6).
