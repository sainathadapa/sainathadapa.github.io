description: "Post detailing my org-mode configuration"

/*This is a work in progress*/

Org-mode has completely changed the way I create tasks, take notes, and in general, made my life a whole lot easier in many ways. In this post, I'll detail the way I use org-mode and the related configuration options, both internal and external to org-mode.

Note: This post is not meant to be a tutorial. Basic understanding of org-mode and elisp/emacs is presumed.

## Emacs
I use three [Capture](http://orgmode.org/manual/Capture.html) templates:

1. *Work tasks (w)*: This adds a new todo to the work.org file
2. *Other tasks (t)*: This adds a new todo to the tasks.org file. I use this to quickly capture just about any task, which is not work related. At a later point, when I review my tasks, I move the tasks from tasks.org to a more suitable location.
3. *Journal (j)*: This adds a line with the current time to the journal file. I use this to quickly jot down one-line journal entries. Sadly, this is not a capture template that I use often, although I should.

And here is configuration:
``` {elisp}
(global-set-key (kbd "<f6>") 'org-capture)
(setq org-capture-templates
      (quote (
              ("w"         ; hotkey
               "Work Todo" ; name
               entry       ; type
               (file+headline "~/Dropbox/org/work.org" "Tasks") ;target
               "* TODO %^{Description}\n:PROPERTIES:\n:Added: %U\n:END:" ; template
               )
              ("t"
               "Task Diary"
               entry
               (file+datetree "~/Dropbox/org/tasks.org")
               "* TODO %^{Description}\n:PROPERTIES:\n:Added: %U\n:END:")
              ("j"
               "Journal"
               entry
               (file+datetree "~/Dropbox/org/journal.org")
               "** %U - %^{Activity}")
              )))
```

## Mobile device
I use the [Orgzly](http://www.orgzly.com/) app to capture notes or ToDos while on mobile.

## Chrome
There are few cases where I want to capture a todo right from the browser, instead of switching/opening emacs. I use the 'Push by Zapier' chrome extension to achieve this.

## Calendar
I like to have my calendar events be visible in org-mode. I had setup Zapier such that every new calendar event gets transfered as a todo to a org file.

## Pocket
I use Pocket extensively, both on mobile and on browser, to save interesting articles that I find on twitter or reddit. Most of the times, I consume these articles via Pocket. But sometimes, I want to stash articles into a org file. It may be because a particular article is a long read, and I want to take notes from this article at a later point. Or it may be because the article points to a task. I use IFTTT service to transfer articles from Pocket to a org file, whenever I 'favorite' a article in Pocket.
